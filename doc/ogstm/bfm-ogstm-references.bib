@article{lazzari_seasonal_2012,
	abstract = {Abstract. This study presents a model of chlorophyll and primary production in the pelagic Mediterranean Sea. A 3-D-biogeochemical model ({OPATM}-{BFM}) was adopted to explore specific system characteristics and quantify dynamics of key biogeochemical variables over a 6 yr period, from 1999 to 2004. We show that, on a basin scale, the Mediterranean Sea is characterised by a high degree of spatial and temporal variability in terms of primary production and chlorophyll concentrations. On a spatial scale, important horizontal and vertical gradients have been observed. According to the simulations over a 6 yr period, the developed model correctly simulated the climatological features of deep chlorophyll maxima and chlorophyll west-east gradients, as well as the seasonal variability in the main offshore regions that were studied. The integrated net primary production highlights north-south gradients that differ from surface net primary production gradients and illustrates the importance of resolving spatial and temporal variations to calculate basin-wide budgets and their variability. According to the model, the western Mediterranean, in particular the Alboran Sea, can be considered mesotrophic, whereas the eastern Mediterranean is oligotrophic. During summer stratified period, notable differences between surface net primary production variability and the corresponding vertically integrated production rates have been identified, suggesting that care must be taken when inferring productivity in such systems from satellite observations alone. Finally, specific simulations that were designed to explore the role of external fluxes and light penetration were performed. The subsequent results show that the effects of atmospheric and terrestrial nutrient loads on the total integrated net primary production account for less than 5 \% of the its annual value, whereas an increase of 30 \% in the light extinction factor impacts primary production by approximately 10 \%.},

@article{lazzari_cdom_2021,
	abstract = {This study investigates the spatial and temporal variability of chromophoric-dissolved organic matter ({CDOM}) in the Mediterranean Sea. The analysis is carried out using a state-of-the-art 3D biogeochemical model. The model describes the plankton dynamics, the cycles of the most important limiting nutrients, and the particulate and dissolved pools of carbon. The source of {CDOM} is directly correlated to the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) by a fixed production quota. Then {CDOM} degrades by photobleaching and remineralization. The main innovation of the system is the inclusion of a bio-optical radiative transfer model that computes surface upwelling irradiance, and therefore simulates remotely sensed reflectance (Rrs). Simulation results of three model configurations are evaluated using satellite Rrs, particularly at 412 nm, 443 nm, and 490 nm. All simulations show a winter minimum in Rrs for the considered bands. However, different parameterizations of {DOC}-release induce a different accumulation of {CDOM}, especially in the eastern Mediterranean, and a different Rrs signature: a more active microbial loop during summer implies a decrease of Rrs at 412 nm. We demonstrate how the usage of a bio-optical model allows us to corroborate hypotheses on {CDOM}-cycling based on blue--violet Rrs data, supporting the importance of this complementary data stream with respect to satellite-derived chlorophyll.},

@report{alvarez_chromophoric_2023,
	abstract = {Abstract. Chromophoric dissolved organic matter ({CDOM}) significantly contributes to the non-water absorption budget in the Mediterranean Sea. The absorption coefficient of {CDOM}, α{CDOM}(λ), is measurable in situ and remotely from different platforms and can be used as an indicator of the concentration of other relevant biogeochemical variables, e.g., dissolved organic carbon. However, our ability to model the biogeochemical processes that determine {CDOM} concentrations is still limited. Here we propose a novel parametrisation of the {CDOM} cycle that accounts for the interplay between the light- and nutrient-dependent dynamics of local {CDOM} production and degradation, as well as its vertical transport. The parameterization is included in a one-dimensional (1D) configuration of the Biogeochemical Flux Model ({BFM}), which is here coupled to the General Ocean Turbulence Model ({GOTM}) through the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models ({FABM}). Here {BFM} is augmented with a bio-optical component that revolves spectrally the underwater light transmission. We did run this new {GOTM}-{FABM}-{BFM} configuration to simulate the seasonal α{CDOM}(λ) cycle at the deep-water site of the {BOUSSOLE} project in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea. Our results show that accounting for both nutrient and light dependence of {CDOM} production improves the simulation of the seasonal and vertical dynamics of α{CDOM}(λ), including a subsurface maximum that forms in spring and progressively intensifies in summer. Furthermore, the model consistently reproduces the higher-than-average concentrations of {CDOM} per unit chlorophyll concentration observed at {BOUSSOLE}. The configuration, outputs and sensitivity analyses from this 1D model application will be instrumental for future applications of {BFM} to the entire Mediterranean Sea in a 3D configuration.},
