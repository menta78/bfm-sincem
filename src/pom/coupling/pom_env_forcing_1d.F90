!DESCRIPTION    
! 
!  This subroutine is called from subroutine pom_bfm_1d  and 
!  calls the routines that provides BFM with all the needed information 
!  about the physical environment:
!
!   pom_to_bfm: Transfers the  POM state variables into the correspondent
!               BFM's.
! 
!   CalcVerticalExtinction: computes the light vertical extinction coefficients.
!
!   CalcLightDistribution: define the irradiance vertical profile.
